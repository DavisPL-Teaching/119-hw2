Part 1: MapReduce

In our first part, we will practice using MapReduce
to create several pipelines.

As you complete your code, you can run the code with

    python3 part1.py
    pytest part1.py

and you can view the output so far in:

    output/part1-answers.txt

In general, follow the same guidelines as in HW1!
Make sure that the output in part1-answers.txt looks correct.
If you aren't sure of the type of the output, please post a question on Piazza.

===== Questions 1-3: Generalized Map and Reduce =====

We will first implement the generalized version of MapReduce.
It works on (key, value) pairs:

- During the map stage, for each (key1, value1) pairs we
  create a list of (key2, value2) pairs.
  All of the values are output as the result of the map stage.

- During the reduce stage, we will apply a reduce_by_key
  function (value2, value2) -> value2
  that describes how to combine two values.
  The values (key2, value2) will be grouped
  by key, then values of each key key2
  will be combined (in some order) until there
  are no values of that key left. It should end up with a single
  (key2, value2) pair for each key.

using operations on RDDs.

If you have done it correctly, the following test should pass.

===== Questions 11-19: MapReduce Edge Cases =====

For the last few questions, we will explore interesting edge cases
in MapReduce.

11. One edge case occurs when there is no output for the reduce stage.
This can happen if the map stage returns an empty list (for all keys).

Demonstrate this edge case by creating a specific pipeline which uses
our data set from Q4. It should use the general_map and general_reduce functions.

Output a set of (key, value) pairs after the reduce stage.

12. What happened? Explain below.

=== ANSWER Q12 BELOW ===

=== END OF Q12 ANSWER ===

13. Finally, we will explore a second edge case, where the reduce stage can
output different values depending on the order of the input.
This leads to something called "nondeterminism", where the output of the
pipeline can even change between runs!

First, take a look at the definition of your general_reduce function.
Why could it be the case that the output of the reduce stage is different
depending on the order of the input?

=== ANSWER Q13 BELOW ===

=== END OF Q13 ANSWER ===

14.
Now demonstrate this edge case by writing a specific example below.
As before, you should use the same dataset from Q4.

Important: Please create an example where the output of the reduce stage is a set of (integer, integer) pairs.
